# Realization-of-a-centralized-server-for-managing-several-communication-groups.

In this part, we consider a centralized server and several communication groups. Each member is represented by a node in the network.
In this case, the server must do the following:
- Management of groups (creation, destruction of a group, insertion of a new member, deletion of a member, delivery of the list of the members of a group and their addresses ...)
- Broadcast messages between the nodes offering a cosistant order to the reception.
